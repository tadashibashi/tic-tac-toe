A simple game of Tic-tac-toe with optional computer opponent.

The AI may be near-impossible to beat at this time. Varying 
levels will be implemented at a later time.

A live build can be found

### Installation

To install and run, you'll need NodeJS installed on your computer.

```

All deliverables should then be available in the `dist/` folder. 

### Future Development
